# My Wanu app components
Wanu is a PWA created for a school project for the Mohole school, I took care of the orders (ordini) section and the news section
## Orders (ordini)

For the creation of the orders section I made 3 components:
* OrdersList.js
* Total.js
* Textarea.js

imported into Orders.js.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
