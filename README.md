# My Wanu app components
Wanu is a progressive web app that I create for a Mohole school project, I take care of the orders (ordini) section and the news section.

Find the complete app here: https://scuola.mohole.it
## Orders (ordini)

For the creation of the orders section I made four components:
* OrdersList.js
* Total.js
* Textarea.js
* ButtonCS.js

I have imported the first three (OrdersList.js, Total.js and Textarea.js) into Orders.js and the last one (ButtonCS.js) in Textarea.js.

Below I put two example screenshot.

## News

For the creation of the news section I only made one component, namely Advise.js imported in News.js.

Below I put an example screenshot.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
